## 🧠 Architecture & Logic

- **Weather API Requests** are modularized via Axios in `/app/api/weather.js`.
- **User Location** is obtained using the Geolocation API with fallback to Lagos, Nigeria.
- **Forecast Data** is processed with timezone awareness and transformed for cleaner UI rendering.
- **State Management** uses Jotai for location selection and global state sharing.
- **Error Handling** includes fallback UI with Mantine Notification component.

---

## 🧪 Testing & Optimization

- Fully responsive with `AppShell` layout from Mantine
- Input fields with `Autocomplete` and keyboard navigation
- Accessible components with proper ARIA props
- Code split for performance
